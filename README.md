#Linked List

This is an implementation of the linked list data structure in javascript.

## Features

Constructor method initializes the linked list head to null and intializes the length property to 0
All methods that add or remove elements in the linked list update the length property.

- Contains symbol.iterator method that allows users to iterate over the linked list.  
- Contains append method that takes a val as an arguement and adds it to the end of the linked list.

- Contains pop method which removes the last element in the linked list and returns its value.  
- Contains removeFirst method which removes the first element in the linked list.

- Contains removeAt method which takes an arguement index which removes the element at that index.  
- Contains the indexOf method which takes a value as an arguement and returns the index of the first istance of this value.  
- Contains get method which takes an index as an arguement and returns the value at the given index.  
- Contains a clear method which clears the data in the linked list.  
- Contains a reverse method which reverses the order of elements in the linked list.  
- Contains isEmpty method which returns a bool value indicating whether the linked list is empty or not.  
- Contains a print method which logs the each elements next and val properties.  
- Contains a toString method which gives a string representation of the linked list.  
- Contains a toArray method which returns an array representation of the linked list.
